KNOWN BUGS
 - OpenCV library causes small memory leacks
 - detectROI.dll has memory leacks
 - using variable names the same as the function names may crash the program
 - dm function fails if spaces are used in matrix definition string
 - unpaired ' crash the program (FindChar function bug)

HISTORY

ver. 2.6.4
	really serious bug found in C_InterpBase::FindVariable (this function was developed 2 years ago, amazing that everything worked perfectly up to now)
ver 2.6.2
	added support for registry (no more problems with missing dlls)

ver 2.0
	added Dump method in C_Matrix_Container
	added support for external functions (currently Interface ver. 1.0 and 2.0)
